% There many ways to get a bibliography style
% 1. Use thesis.bst as included in this package (reasonable layout)
% 2. Customize thesis.dbj and rerun "latex thesis.dbj" to produce a new thesis.bst
%    (for experienced user)
% 3. Run "tex makebst.tex" (using makebst.tex from the custom-bib package) to create your own DBJ & BST-file
%    (for the very experienced user)
% 4. Code your BST file from scratch (for the BibTeX nerd)

% thesis.bst as included should be a good start, though
\bibliographystyle{plain}

% Use bibtex to manage your references
% Jabref is a useful tool for editing a bibtex file
% The bibtex file modelman.bib included in this template
% is a snapshot of the main bibtex file of the group.
% The most recent version is in the CVS directory papers/bib
% In any case, give complete information about the references:
% Authors, title, place of publication (conference,journal),
% Year of publication, page numbers, URL if the document is
% also available online.
\bibliography{modelman}
