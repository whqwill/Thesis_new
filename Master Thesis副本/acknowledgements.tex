\noindent 
I would like to thank the computer science 5 - information and database systems for supporting my master thesis. I would like to express my great gratitude for the support of PD Dr. Christoph Quix and Rihan Hai. Their patient guidance helps me a lot during the research of this topic. Errors and omissions remain mine. I would also like to thank to Fleming, his colleagues, USPTO and Europe PMC. The free access to their datasets helps me to finish the master thesis.
