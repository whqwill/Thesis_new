\vspace{2cm}
This master thesis describes an automatic approach for the inventor identification. This approach combines the text-mining technique, the logistic regression, clustering algorithms and the patent-publication matching technique. The approach aims at making use of the available information of the patents and providing an reliable methods to disambiguate the inventors. This master thesis provides the overview of the approach, describes the Java implementation and assesses its accuracy. The evaluation of the approached is mainly based on the patent data from the United States.
