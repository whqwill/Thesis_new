\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:concl}

\begin{itemize}
\item Briefly summarize the contents of your thesis.
\item Discuss the results: what are the important conclusions which can
be drawn from your work?
\item Give a brief outlook for future work. List only a few points (2-4),
      but avoid trivial issues such as ``The user interface has to be improved''
      or ``There needs to be more testing''.
\end{itemize}
